        <h1>Hiring Pipeline Calculator</h1>
        <p>
          Building a hiring pipeline is one of the most critical aspects of
          growing a team. But how many candidates do you actually need to reach
          out to in order to make one hire?
        </p>
        <p>
          This calculator works <strong>backwards from one hire</strong>,
          calculating how many candidates you need at each stage based on your
          conversion rates.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Use</h2>
        <h3>Adjust the Rates</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Edit the percentage fields under "Rate" for each pipeline stage
          </li>
          <li>
            Each rate represents the percentage of candidates who move to the
            next stage
          </li>
          <li>
            For example, if 4% of your outreach gets a response, enter 4 in the
            Response/Interest rate field
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Set Your Timeline</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Enter your target "Weeks to Hire" - this is how soon you need a hire
          </li>
          <li>
            The calculator shows how many candidates you need to reach out to
            per week
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Share Your Scenario</h3>
