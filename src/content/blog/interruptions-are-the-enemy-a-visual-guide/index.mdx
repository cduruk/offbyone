## Introduction

When was the last time you had a good day of work? The kind where you felt like you actually made progress on something hard, where you got into flow and stayed there long enough to think deeply about a problem?

Paul Graham wrote about this back in 2009 in ["Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule"](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html). He explained how a single meeting can wreck an entire half-day for someone who needs uninterrupted time to build something. That was 15 years ago, and the problem has only gotten worse. We've added Slack, Teams, always-on video calls, "quick syncs," and a culture of instant responsiveness that treats every message like it deserves an immediate reply.

And yet, when people complain about this—when they say they can't focus anymore, that they're constantly interrupted, that their days feel like chaos—the conversation stays frustratingly vague. We know it's bad, but we can't say _how_ bad. We can't quantify what's happening or predict what would happen if things changed. We're stuck arguing about vibes instead of facts.

I got tired of that. So I built a model.

In this post, I'm going to show you what interruption-driven work actually looks like when you model it with math. We'll start by drawing a single day as a timeline—interruptions, recovery periods, and the fragments of focus time that remain. Then I'll show you the three simple parameters that determine whether your day is productive or a write-off. We'll simulate hundreds of days under the same conditions, and we'll build a map of the entire parameter space so you can see exactly where you are and what happens when you try to move to better territory.

By the end, you'll stop thinking of "bad days" as mysterious vibes and start seeing them as the predictable output of a system you can actually reason about—and change. Or not! But maybe?

## One Day in Detail

Let's start by drawing what one of those "lost days" actually looks like. The visualization below shows an 8-hour workday as a timeline. Green segments represent real, uninterrupted focus blocks—the time when you're genuinely working on the problem. Red spikes are interruptions: a Slack ping, a meeting, someone asking a question. The hatched gray zones are recovery time—you're back at your desk, but you're not back _in_ the problem yet. You're reloading context, remembering where you were, trying to rebuild the mental stack you just lost.

<div class="not-prose my-8 w-full">
  <DayDetailEmbed
    lambda={2.0}
    delta={20}
    len={60}
    seed={42}
    day={5}
    showNavigation={false}
    client:load
  />
</div>

Look at this day. Notice how often the red interruptions land. Notice how much of your 8 hours is actually gray recovery time, not green focus time. Count how many genuine 60-minute blocks you got—chances are, it's zero or one. You spent the whole day "working," but very little of it was uninterrupted work.

This looks chaotic: random hits, weird gaps, and somehow you end up with almost no 60‑minute blocks. But under the hood, this day is completely determined by just three numbers.

Let me show you what those numbers are.

## Three Knobs That Secretly Define Your Day

**λ (lambda): How often the world is allowed to bother you.**

Lambda is your interruption rate, measured in interruptions per hour (modeled as a [Poisson process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process)). If λ = 2, that means you're getting interrupted, on average, twice every hour. In the timeline above, lambda determines how many red spikes you see. It's a function of your environment: how many meetings you have, how many Slack channels you're in, how many people feel entitled to "just a quick question," whether your company culture treats every message as urgent.

Most people dramatically underestimate their real λ. But we'll ground this in research in a moment.

**Δ (delta): How long your brain sulks after each interruption.**

Delta is your recovery time, in minutes. When someone interrupts you, you don't instantly return to full productivity the moment they walk away. Your brain needs time to reload the context, reconstruct the mental model, remember what you were doing. That's delta. In the timeline, it's the width of those hatched gray bars after every red spike. Even a "quick two-minute question" can cost you [15–20 minutes of recovery time](https://ics.uci.edu/~gmark/chi08-mark.pdf).

Delta varies by person and by task. It's shorter if you left yourself good breadcrumbs before the interruption. It's longer if you're doing deep, complex work. But it's never zero.

**θ (theta): How big a chunk your work needs to be meaningful.**

Theta is the minimum uninterrupted time required for a "unit" of real work. If you're writing code, reviewing a design, or solving a hard problem, you probably need at least 30–60 minutes of continuous focus to make meaningful progress. That's theta. It's why five 10-minute blocks don't add up to one 50-minute block—below theta, the work doesn't compound.

In the timeline, theta is what you're measuring the green blocks against. If theta is 60 minutes and you only have 45-minute blocks, you're not getting any "real" work done by your own standards.

Now, here's the key idea. We can write a simple formula that counts how many units of real work you accomplish in a day. Given all your focus blocks (the green segments), we count how many theta-sized chunks fit. You can call this "the capacity" of your day to carry enough blocks for you. The higher the capacity, the more productive you are in a given day.

$$
C(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left\lfloor \frac{d_i}{\theta} \right\rfloor
$$

Where:

- $d_i$ is the duration (in minutes) of focus block $i$
- $\theta$ is your minimum uninterrupted time for one "unit" of real work
- $\lfloor x \rfloor$ is the floor function (round down to the nearest integer)

In plain English: for each focus block, divide its length by theta and round down. Then add them all up. That's your capacity for the day.

Once we write your day as a function of these three parameters—λ for how noisy your environment is, Δ for how sticky interruptions are, and θ for how demanding your work is—we can stop treating bad days as vibes and start treating them as a model we can reason about.

Let's ground this model in reality.

## What λ and Δ Look Like in Real Jobs

You might be wondering: what are typical values for λ and Δ? Are these made-up parameters, or do they correspond to something measurable in the real world?

They're very real. Researchers have been studying interruptions and recovery times for decades, across different roles and environments. Here's what the data says:

| Job Role            | Interruptions/Hour | Recovery Time | Notes                                                                | Source                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Knowledge Workers   | ~15                | ~23 min       | General office roles, frequent task switching                        | [Bailey et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1145/3313831.3376720)                                                                              |
| Heavy Collaborators | ~30 (every 2 min)  | Not specified | High-communication environments (e.g., PMs, team leads)              | [Microsoft Work Trend Index, 2025](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/04/23/the-2025-annual-work-trend-index-the-frontier-firm-is-born/) |
| Software Developers | 4–6                | 10–45 min     | Long recovery for regaining coding context; 1 flow block/day typical | [Meyer et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1145/3134690)                                                                                       |
| Designers           | Estimated 10–15    | ~20–30 min    | Similar to developers, often require deep creative focus             | Inferred from knowledge worker data + flow research                                                                                         |

These studies are essentially measuring λ (interruptions per hour) and Δ (time to regain focus). And the numbers are sobering.

Bailey et al. found that knowledge workers face around 15 interruptions per hour—that's λ = 15, or one interruption every four minutes. The Microsoft Work Trend Index reports that heavy collaborators (PMs, team leads) can see 30 interruptions per hour—λ = 30, or one every two minutes. Even software developers, who often have more control over their environment, still face 4–6 interruptions per hour and take 10–45 minutes to fully recover.

Now look back at the visualizations in this post. The interactive tools focus on λ between 0 and 4 per hour, and Δ between 5 and 30 minutes. **These are the polite, toned-down versions of reality.** If Bailey et al. see λ = 15 and Microsoft sees λ = 30 for heavy collaborators, our λ = 2–3 examples are actually best-case scenarios for many real environments.

Keep this in mind as we explore the rest of the post. When you see a "typical" (amber) or "terrible" (red) regime highlighted, understand that many real jobs live at or beyond the right edge of the map.

## 100 Days Under the Same Conditions

We've seen one day. But one day can be a fluke—maybe you got lucky, or maybe you got unlucky. What happens if we simulate 100 days with the same λ, Δ, and θ?

That's what the grid below shows. Each square is one simulated 8-hour workday. The color encodes the longest continuous focus block you got that day. Darker, richer colors mean longer focus blocks—those are the high-capacity days. Dim, washed-out cells are the low-capacity days, where you never got more than 15–30 minutes of uninterrupted time.

Here's what 100 days look like under relatively harsh conditions: λ = 2.0 (two interruptions per hour), Δ = 20 (20-minute recovery), θ = 60 (you need 60-minute blocks to count as "real work"):

<div class="not-prose my-8 w-full">
  <DaysGridEmbed
    lambda={2.0}
    delta={20}
    len={60}
    target={1}
    seed={42}
    showOverlay={true}
    client:load
  />
</div>

Look at the distribution. Many days are dim—barely any focus blocks over 30 minutes. A few days are brighter, but they're rare. This is what it feels like when you say "some weeks, I just can't get anything done." You're not imagining it. Given these parameters, the math makes it structurally difficult to have consistent high-capacity days.

And remember: λ = 2.0 is _generous_ compared to the research. Bailey et al. report λ ≈ 15 for general knowledge workers. Meyer et al. report λ = 4–6 for developers. Even this "typical" grid is more forgiving than many real-world environments.

### What the Research Data Actually Looks Like

So what does it look like when we use the actual research numbers? Here's 100 days with λ = 15 (the Bailey et al. knowledge worker data—one interruption every four minutes) and Δ = 25 (moderate recovery time):

<div class="not-prose my-8 w-full">
  <DaysGridEmbed
    lambda={15}
    delta={25}
    len={60}
    target={1}
    seed={999}
    showOverlay={true}
    client:load
  />
</div>

If you're looking at this grid and thinking "is the visualization broken?"—I had the same reaction when I first generated it. The entire grid is gray. Uniform hatched patterns, no color variation, no visible focus blocks. It looks like a rendering bug.

But it's not broken. Here's what a single day at these parameters actually looks like:

<div class="not-prose my-8 w-full">
  <DayDetailEmbed
    lambda={15}
    delta={25}
    len={60}
    seed={999}
    day={1}
    showNavigation={false}
    client:load
  />
</div>

Now you can see why the grid appears uniformly gray. It's not a bug—it's reality. Look at the day view: a dense wall of red interruptions, each triggering a gray recovery period. The tiny slivers of green focus time are too short to even render at the grid scale. When you zoom out to 100 days, every single day looks like this.

This is a crisis. Bailey et al. measured λ = 15 for general knowledge workers. Microsoft reports λ = 30 for heavy collaborators. These aren't edge cases—they're describing millions of people's actual working conditions. And at these parameters, the math is unambiguous: deep work isn't just hard, it's statistically near-impossible. We've normalized an environment where focus has been engineered out of the workday, and we're surprised when people can't think.

**An important caveat:** These simulations use a Poisson process, which assumes interruptions arrive randomly and uniformly throughout the day. In reality, interruptions tend to cluster—back-to-back meetings, Slack storms after a big announcement, email bursts when you return from lunch. This clustering cuts both ways. Sometimes it leaves clean gaps (your afternoon block after a morning full of meetings). But often it makes things worse, because clustered interruptions compound recovery time and eliminate any chance of regaining focus between hits. The extreme case shown here is actually somewhat optimistic if your interruptions cluster poorly.

Now let's see what happens if we move to a better regime. Same 8-hour days, same θ = 60, but now λ = 1.0 (one interruption per hour) and Δ = 10 (10-minute recovery):

<div class="not-prose my-8 w-full">
  <DaysGridEmbed
    lambda={1.0}
    delta={10}
    len={60}
    target={1}
    seed={123}
    showOverlay={true}
    client:load
  />
</div>

Look at the difference. Many more days have at least one solid 60-minute block. The dim "hopeless" days are much rarer. The distribution has shifted—not because you suddenly became more disciplined, but because the system's parameters changed.

This is the core insight: **the variability you experience across days is structural, not personal.** When λ and Δ are high, bad days are common. When λ and Δ are lower, good days become routine.

## The Map of Deep Work

So far we've fixed the knobs (λ, Δ, θ) and watched the random outcomes (individual days, grids of 100 days). Now let's see what happens when we actually turn those knobs—when we vary λ and Δ systematically and measure the result.

That's what a parameter-space heatmap does. It's a map. One axis is λ (interruptions per hour). The other axis is Δ (recovery minutes). Each cell represents a specific (λ, Δ) combination, and the color shows the expected capacity (number of θ-minute blocks per day). Dark purple cells are hospitable to deep work. Light purple cells are hostile—you're lucky to get even one θ-block per day.

Here's the map, with a threshold control that lets you toggle θ between 30, 45, and 60 minutes. I've highlighted three specific cells with color-coded borders:

- **\{ λ = 1.0, Δ = 10 \}** — the "good" regime (few interruptions, fast recovery) — **green border**
- **\{ λ = 2.0, Δ = 20 \}** — the "typical" regime (moderate interruptions, moderate recovery) — **amber border**
- **\{ λ = 3.0, Δ = 25 \}** — the "terrible" regime (frequent interruptions, slow recovery) — **red border**

<div class="not-prose my-8 w-full">
  <FocusBlocksHeatmapEmbed
    threshold={60}
    showThresholdControl={true}
    highlightedCells={[
      { lambda: 1.0, delta: 10, color: '#22c55e' },
      { lambda: 2.0, delta: 20, color: '#f59e0b' },
      { lambda: 3.0, delta: 25, color: '#ef4444' },
    ]}
    client:load
  />
</div>

Spend a moment looking at the three color-coded cells. These aren't arbitrary—they're anchored in the research we saw earlier:

- The **"good" regime** (green border, λ = 1.0, Δ = 10) is better than most real-world environments. It's closer to a protected morning on a maker's schedule, or a team that's serious about focus time.
- The **"typical" regime** (amber border, λ = 2.0, Δ = 20) is still more generous than the ~15 interruptions/hour Bailey et al. report for general knowledge workers, but it's already rough for 60-minute deep work.
- The **"terrible" regime** (red border, λ = 3.0, Δ = 25) is a softened version of the heavy-collaborator world (30 interruptions/hour). The actual PM/team-lead reality often lives off the right edge of this chart.

Now use the threshold control to toggle θ between 30, 45, and 60 minutes. Watch what happens to the three highlighted cells:

- In the **"good" regime** (green border), the cell stays relatively bright even at θ = 60. High capacity: you can expect multiple 60-minute blocks per day.
- In the **"typical" regime** (amber border), the cell looks okay at θ = 30, dims at θ = 45, and nearly dies at θ = 60. The capacity collapses as θ increases—this is why you feel like you can handle small tasks but never get to the hard problems.
- In the **"terrible" regime** (red border), the cell is basically dark at any θ that matters. Near-zero capacity: even 30-minute blocks are rare.

### The Capacity Formula in Action

Remember the capacity formula from earlier? Let's see it work on a concrete example. Suppose you have a day with three focus blocks: 90 minutes, 45 minutes, and 20 minutes. Your total focus time is 155 minutes. But how much _capacity_ do you have—how many units of real work can you complete?

It depends on θ. Watch how the same focus time translates into wildly different capacities:

**For θ = 30 minutes:**

$$
C(30) = \left\lfloor \frac{90}{30} \right\rfloor
      + \left\lfloor \frac{45}{30} \right\rfloor
      + \left\lfloor \frac{20}{30} \right\rfloor
      = 3 + 1 + 0 = 4
$$

Four units of work. Not bad.

**For θ = 45 minutes:**

$$
C(45) = \left\lfloor \frac{90}{45} \right\rfloor
      + \left\lfloor \frac{45}{45} \right\rfloor
      + \left\lfloor \frac{20}{45} \right\rfloor
      = 2 + 1 + 0 = 3
$$

Three units. The 20-minute block is now too small to count, and the 90-minute block only yields two units instead of three.

**For θ = 60 minutes:**

$$
C(60) = \left\lfloor \frac{90}{60} \right\rfloor
      + \left\lfloor \frac{45}{60} \right\rfloor
      + \left\lfloor \frac{20}{60} \right\rfloor
      = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1
$$

One unit. Only the 90-minute block survives. The 45-minute and 20-minute blocks are now useless for this kind of work.

Same 155 minutes of total focus time. But depending on θ, your capacity ranges from 4 down to 1. This is why the heatmap changes so dramatically when you toggle the threshold control—because the floor function is unforgiving. Small changes in θ or in the length of your focus blocks can collapse your capacity.

### The Map for θ = 60 (Deep Work)

Here's the same map, but frozen at θ = 60 and with the threshold control removed. This is the world of serious deep work—the kind of tasks that demand an hour or more of uninterrupted focus:

<div class="not-prose my-8 w-full">
  <FocusBlocksHeatmapEmbed
    threshold={60}
    showThresholdControl={false}
    highlightedCells={[
      { lambda: 1.0, delta: 10, color: '#22c55e' },
      { lambda: 2.0, delta: 20, color: '#f59e0b' },
      { lambda: 3.0, delta: 25, color: '#ef4444' },
    ]}
    client:load
  />
</div>

Look at how small the hospitable region is. The top-left corner (low λ, low Δ) is bright, but it doesn't take much movement rightward or downward before the map turns dark. The three highlighted cells tell the story:

- **"Good" regime** (green border): Still bright. High capacity: you can routinely expect 60-minute blocks.
- **"Typical" regime** (amber border): Already dim. Low capacity: maybe one 60-minute block per day, often zero.
- **"Terrible" regime** (red border): Almost black. Near-zero capacity: 60-minute blocks are lottery-ticket rare.

And remember: these highlighted regimes are calibrated against the research. The "typical" cell (λ = 2.0, Δ = 20) is actually _better_ than what many knowledge workers experience. If your real λ is closer to the Bailey et al. numbers (λ ≈ 15) or the Microsoft numbers (λ ≈ 30), you're living off the right edge of this map, in territory where 60-minute deep work is functionally impossible without drastic intervention.

## How a Better Day Actually Looks

We've seen the grids and the heatmaps. Now let's return to the day-level view and see, visually, what it looks like to move from the "typical" (amber) regime to the "good" (green) one.

Here's another day from the "typical" regime (λ = 2.0, Δ = 20, θ = 60), same parameters as the first timeline we saw:

<div class="not-prose my-8 w-full">
  <DayDetailEmbed
    lambda={2.0}
    delta={20}
    len={60}
    seed={43}
    day={7}
    showNavigation={false}
    client:load
  />
</div>

Look familiar? Lots of red interruptions. Wide gray recovery zones. Very few green blocks longer than 45 minutes. This is what a structurally difficult day looks like. And remember: λ = 2.0 is actually generous compared to the research data—many real environments have λ = 4, 6, or even 15.

Now here's a day from the "good" regime (λ = 1.0, Δ = 10, θ = 60):

<div class="not-prose my-8 w-full">
  <DayDetailEmbed
    lambda={1.0}
    delta={10}
    len={60}
    seed={123}
    day={2}
    showNavigation={false}
    client:load
  />
</div>

The difference is striking. Fewer interruptions. Narrower recovery zones. More and longer green focus blocks. You can see multiple 60-minute chunks—actual capacity for deep work.

This is what happens when you move from the "typical" highlighted cell on the heatmap to the "good" one. The change in parameters is modest: λ drops from 2.0 to 1.0 (one fewer interruption per hour), and Δ drops from 20 to 10 (ten fewer minutes of recovery). But the impact on your day is dramatic.

The point is not that you need to hit these exact numbers. The point is that **you have levers you can pull**, and moving even partway toward the "good" regime makes a visible, measurable difference.

## How to Move Around the Map

So far this post has been diagnostic: I've shown you what your day looks like under the hood, named the three parameters that determine whether it's productive or a disaster, grounded those parameters in research, and given you a map of the terrain. Now let's talk about what you can actually _do_ with this model.

You have three levers. Let's take them one at a time.

### Reduce λ – Fewer Interruptions Per Hour

Lambda is about **access**. It's a function of how many people and systems are allowed to interrupt you, and how often.

**At the team or org level:**

- **Office hours** instead of always-on Slack. Designate specific windows when you're interruptible, and protect the rest.
- **Batch meetings** to create clean focus zones. If you have three 30-minute meetings scattered across the day, you've fragmented the entire day. If you stack them back-to-back in one 90-minute block, you've left the rest of the day intact.
- **Clear norms** about when to DM, when to @-mention, what counts as urgent. Most messages aren't actually urgent, but in the absence of norms, everything defaults to "interrupt immediately."

**At the individual level:**

- **Harden your notification settings.** Turn off Slack/email notifications during focus blocks. Use Do Not Disturb liberally.
- **Check messages in batches.** Instead of responding to every ping immediately, check Slack or email twice per hour (or less). This moves you from λ = 15 to λ = 2.
- **Defend specific hours.** Block out 2–3 hours in the morning as "no meetings, minimal messages." Treat it like a standing meeting with yourself.

**What this looks like on the map:**

Reducing λ moves you leftward on the heatmap—from the red-bordered "terrible" regime or amber-bordered "typical" regime toward the green-bordered "good" one. It's the most powerful lever you have, because interruptions compound: every interruption not only breaks your current focus but also triggers a Δ-minute recovery period. If you cut λ in half, you more than double your capacity.

**Tie to research:**

This is how you move from the "heavy collaborator" world (λ ≈ 30) toward the "developer" world (λ ≈ 4–6). It's how you get closer to the left edge of the map, where deep work is structurally feasible.

### Reduce Δ – Shorten Recovery Time

Delta is about **stickiness**. It's how long interruptions linger after they're technically over. You can't make Δ zero, but you can shave minutes off each recovery, and those minutes compound quickly.

**Work hygiene:**

- **Leave yourself breadcrumbs** before switching tasks. When you're interrupted, write a one-sentence note about what you were doing and what comes next. This shortens the reload time when you return.
- **Avoid wide context switches.** If you're interrupted while coding, handling a quick code-review question is less disruptive than handling a budget question. Minimize cross-domain bouncing when possible.

**Environment:**

- **Reduce self-interruptions.** Delta applies to self-inflicted interruptions too (checking Twitter, tab-surfing). Every time you pull yourself out of flow, you pay the recovery cost.
- **Small rituals to re-enter focus.** Some people re-read the last few lines of code they wrote, or scan their notes, or take three deep breaths. These rituals can shorten the reload time.

**What this looks like on the map:**

Reducing Δ moves you upward on the heatmap—toward shorter recovery times and brighter cells. The effect is smaller than reducing λ, but it's still meaningful. If you can shave 10 minutes off each recovery, and you have 8 interruptions in a day, you've just reclaimed 80 minutes and increased your capacity for real work.

**Tie to research:**

Meyer et al. report that developers take 10–45 minutes to regain context after an interruption. The variance is huge, and much of it comes from preparedness and task similarity. If you're on the high end (Δ ≈ 40), small hygiene improvements can cut that in half.

### Match θ to Reality – Design Tasks for Your Environment

Theta is different from λ and Δ, because you usually can't change the nature of the work itself. If you're working on a hard problem that genuinely requires 90 minutes of continuous thought, that's just θ = 90—end of story.

But you _can_ design your day as a portfolio of tasks with different θ values, and match them to your realistic λ and Δ conditions.

**Break large projects into smaller tasks:**

If your environment has λ = 3 and you're trying to do θ = 90 work, you're going to have a bad time. The heatmap says so. But if you can decompose that work into tasks with θ = 30, suddenly it becomes feasible.

**Reserve low-λ windows for high-θ work:**

If you can defend a 2-hour window early in the morning with λ ≈ 0, that's where you do your θ = 60–90 work. Use the rest of your day (higher λ) for smaller tasks that tolerate fragmentation.

**Accept that some work is incompatible with some environments:**

If you're a PM or team lead living at λ = 30 (per the Microsoft data), θ = 60 work at 3pm is fantasy. You need to either carve out radically different conditions (early morning, off-site, blocked calendar) or accept that this kind of work simply doesn't happen in your normal day.

**What this looks like on the map:**

You're not moving on the map—you're _choosing a different map_. When you toggle the threshold control on the heatmap from θ = 60 to θ = 30, you're asking a different question: "What environment do I need for 30-minute work instead of 60-minute work?" The map changes, and suddenly the "typical" (amber) and "terrible" (red) regimes look more survivable.

**Tie to research:**

Meyer et al. report that developers often get just one real flow block per day. That's the reality of θ = 60+ work in a typical environment. If you want more units of work per day, either improve the environment (reduce λ and Δ) or reduce θ.

## From "Bad Days" to a Tuneable System

Let's recap the journey.

We started with a single chaotic-looking day: interruptions, recovery periods, and almost no continuous focus time. It felt random, frustrating, like evidence of personal failure.

Then we revealed the three parameters hidden underneath: **λ** (how noisy your environment is), **Δ** (how sticky interruptions are), and **θ** (how demanding your work is). We grounded those parameters in real research—Bailey et al., Meyer et al., the Microsoft Work Trend Index—and saw that many real-world environments operate at λ = 4, 10, 15, even 30 interruptions per hour, with recovery times of 20–45 minutes. The "typical" regime we explored in this post is actually _generous_ compared to what many people experience.

We simulated 100 days under the same conditions and saw that the variability you experience—some days productive, some days useless—is structural, not a reflection of your discipline or focus. The grids showed us that in the "typical" (amber) regime (λ = 2.0, Δ = 20), good days are rare. In the "good" (green) regime (λ = 1.0, Δ = 10), good days are common.

We built a map of the parameter space and identified three specific regimes—"good" (green), "typical" (amber), and "terrible" (red)—with color-coded borders on the heatmap so you can see exactly where different environments sit. We used the capacity formula to show how the same total focus time can translate into wildly different productivity depending on θ. We toggled the threshold control and watched the map collapse as θ increased from 30 to 60 minutes, because the floor function is unforgiving.

We returned to the day-level view and saw, visually, what a "typical" day and a "good" day look like side-by-side. The difference is stark, and it comes from changing just two numbers: λ and Δ.

Finally, we talked about the three levers you can actually pull: reduce λ (fewer interruptions per hour), reduce Δ (shorter recovery time), and match θ to reality (design tasks for your environment).

Here's the core reassurance: **You're not uniquely undisciplined. You're operating in a system where, given your λ and Δ, deep work is mathematically rare unless you deliberately design for it.**

The good news is that you have levers. You can harden your notifications, batch your meetings, leave yourself breadcrumbs, defend specific hours, and match your task granularity to your realistic environment. Even small movements on the map—dropping λ from 3 to 2, or Δ from 25 to 15—can transform your distribution of days.

Try this: pick one week and defend a single 90-minute block each morning. Treat that block as your λ/Δ/θ lab. No meetings, no Slack, no "quick questions." Measure what you accomplish in that block versus the rest of your day. I suspect you'll see the parameters at work.

Underneath these pictures there's real math and decades of interruption research. But you don't need any of that to start using the knobs. If you ever find yourself wondering exactly how the curves are shaped, there's a whole rabbit hole waiting for you.
