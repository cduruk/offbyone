## Introduction

When was the last time you had a good day of work? The kind where you felt like you actually made progress on something hard, where you got into flow and stayed there long enough to think deeply about a problem?

Paul Graham wrote about this back in 2009 in ["Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule"](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html). He explained how a single meeting can wreck an entire half-day for someone who needs uninterrupted time to build something. That was 15 years ago, and the problem has only gotten worse. We've added Slack, Teams, always-on video calls, "quick syncs," and a culture of instant responsiveness that treats every message like it deserves an immediate reply.

And yet, when people complain about this—when they say they can't focus anymore, that they're constantly interrupted, that their days feel like chaos—the conversation stays frustratingly vague. We know it's bad, but we can't say _how_ bad. We can't quantify what's happening or predict what would happen if things changed. We're stuck arguing about vibes instead of facts.

I got tired of that. So I built a model.

In this post, I'm going to show you what interruption-driven work actually looks like when you model it with math. We'll start by drawing a single day as a timeline—interruptions, recovery periods, and the fragments of focus time that remain. Then I'll show you the three simple parameters that determine whether your day is productive or a write-off. We'll simulate hundreds of days under the same conditions, and we'll build a map of the entire parameter space so you can see exactly where you are and what happens when you try to move to better territory.

By the end, you'll stop thinking of "bad days" as mysterious vibes and start seeing them as the predictable output of a system you can actually reason about—and change.

## One Day in Detail

Let's start by drawing what one of those "lost days" actually looks like. The visualization below shows an 8-hour workday as a timeline. Green segments represent real, uninterrupted focus blocks—the time when you're genuinely working on the problem. Red spikes are interruptions: a Slack ping, a meeting, someone asking a question. The hatched gray zones are recovery time—you're back at your desk, but you're not back _in_ the problem yet. And the amber and the red sections are where you are kind of in the zone; where your focus is broken before 30 minutes or 15 minutes respectively. Obviously, the goal is to be in the green (or blue).

<div class="not-prose my-8 w-full">
  <DayDetailEmbed
    lambda={2.0}
    delta={20}
    len={60}
    seed={42}
    day={5}
    showNavigation={false}
    client:load
  />
</div>

Notice how often the red interruptions land. Notice how much of your 8 hours is actually gray recovery time, not green focus time. Count how many genuine 60-minute blocks you got, just one. You spent the whole day "working," but very little of it was uninterrupted work. Is this a good day?

So, how can we begin to understand this day if we want to fix it? In our model, we can boil the day down to 3 numbers that we can try to control.

## Three Knobs That Secretly Define Your Day

| Symbol     | What it measures                                 | Units    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| λ (lambda) | How often you get interrupted                    | per hour |
| Δ (delta)  | How long to regain focus after each interruption | minutes  |
| θ (theta)  | Minimum block size for meaningful work           | minutes  |

**λ (lambda): How often the world is allowed to bother you.**

Lambda is your interruption rate, measured in interruptions per hour (modeled as a [Poisson process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process)). If λ = 2, that means you're getting interrupted, on average, twice every hour. In the timeline above, lambda determines how many red spikes you see. It's a function of your environment: how many meetings you have, how many Slack channels you're in, how many people feel entitled to "just a quick question," whether your company culture treats every message as urgent. Some people, like managers and executives get interrupted a lot. Some people do not, but then they do, such as when they are on-call or doing triage for their team that week.

Most people dramatically underestimate their real λ. But we'll ground this in research in a moment.

**Δ (delta): How long your brain sulks after each interruption.**

Delta is your recovery time, in minutes. When someone interrupts you, you don't instantly return to full productivity the moment they walk away. Your brain needs time to reload the context, reconstruct the mental model, remember what you were doing. That's delta. In the timeline, it's the width of those hatched gray bars after every red spike.

Delta varies by person and by task. It's shorter if you left yourself good breadcrumbs before the interruption. It's longer if you're doing deep, complex work. But it's never zero. More depressingly, even a "quick two-minute question" can cost you [15–20 minutes of recovery time](https://ics.uci.edu/~gmark/chi08-mark.pdf).

**θ (theta): How big a chunk your work needs to be meaningful.**

Theta is the minimum uninterrupted time required for a "unit" of real work. If you're writing code, reviewing a design, or solving a hard problem, you probably need at least 30–60 minutes of continuous focus to make meaningful progress. That's theta. It's also why five 10-minute blocks don't add up to one 50-minute block—below theta, things just don't compound that way. This is **fragmentation**: when interruptions break your time into pieces too small to be useful, even if the total time is the same. It's somewhat related to the recovery time, it's more about how long it takes to actually start being productive at a task versus being able to start it.

In the timeline, theta is what you're measuring the green blocks against. If your theta is 60 minutes and you only have 45-minute blocks, you're not getting any "real" work done by your own standards.

**Capacity**

I know I said three numbers but capacity is just a result of all three. Given how a day looks like based on these three parameters, we can write a simple formula that counts how many units of real work you accomplish in a day. Given all your focus blocks (the green and blue segments), we count how many theta-sized chunks fit. You can call this "the capacity" of your day to carry enough blocks for you. The higher the capacity, the more productive you are in a given day.

$$
C(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left\lfloor \frac{d_i}{\theta} \right\rfloor
$$

Where:

- $d_i$ is the duration (in minutes) of focus block $i$
- $\theta$ is your minimum uninterrupted time for one "unit" of real work
- $\lfloor x \rfloor$ is the floor function (round down to the nearest integer)

In plain English: for each focus block, divide its length by theta and round down. Then add them all up. That's your capacity for the day.

<div class="not-prose my-8 w-full">
  <DayDetailEmbed
    lambda={1.0}
    delta={10}
    len={60}
    seed={88}
    day={3}
    showNavigation={false}
    client:load
  />
</div>

Notice the long stretches of uninterrupted green. Multiple 60-minute blocks. This day has high capacity—the math is working in your favor.

Once we write your day as a function of these three parameters—λ for how noisy your environment is, Δ for how sticky interruptions are, and θ for how demanding your work is—we can stop treating bad days as vibes and start treating them as a model we can reason about.

Let's ground this model in reality.

## What λ and Δ Look Like in Real Jobs

Nothing I've mentioned here is very new. Both people in academia and the industry have been studying these figures for years. We know, for example, the rate of interruptions and the recovery times vary significantly for people across industries and even across role in a given industry.

Here's a very quick, ChatGPT derived version of the latest research:

| Job Role            | Interruptions/Hour | Recovery Time | Source                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Knowledge Workers   | ~15                | ~23 min       | [Bailey et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1145/3313831.3376720)                                                                              |
| PMs / Execs         | ~30 (every 2 min)  | Not specified | [Microsoft Work Trend Index, 2025](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/04/23/the-2025-annual-work-trend-index-the-frontier-firm-is-born/) |
| Software Developers | 4–6                | 10–45 min     | [Meyer et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1145/3134690)                                                                                       |

Bailey et al. found that knowledge workers face around 15 interruptions per hour—that's λ = 15, or one interruption every four minutes. The Microsoft Work Trend Index reports that heavy collaborators (PMs, team leads) can see 30 interruptions per hour—λ = 30, or one every two minutes. Even software developers, who often have more control over their environment, still face 4–6 interruptions per hour and take 10–45 minutes to fully recover.

If those numbers sound crazy or too high to be real, you are not alone. Look back at the visualizations you've seen in this post. So far, we've focused on days where λ is between 0 and 4 per hour, and Δ between 5 and 30 minutes. **These are the polite, toned-down versions of reality.** If Bailey et al. see λ = 15 and Microsoft sees λ = 30 for heavy collaborators, our λ = 2–3 examples are actually best-case scenarios for many real environments.

## 100 Days Under the Same Conditions

So far, we've only looked at a single day. But one day can be a fluke—maybe you got lucky, or maybe you got unlucky. What happens if we simulate 100 days with the same λ, Δ, and θ?

Luckily, we have computers that make simulating many days a trivial task.

On the grid below, each cell is one simulated 8-hour workday. The color encodes the longest continuous focus block you got that day. Darker, richer colors mean longer focus blocks—those are the high-capacity days. Dim, washed-out cells are the low-capacity days, where you never got more than 15–30 minutes of uninterrupted time.

So, here's what 100 days look like under relatively harsh conditions: λ = 3.0 (three interruptions per hour), Δ = 20 (20-minute recovery), θ = 60 (you need two 45-minute blocks to count as "real work"):

<div class="not-prose my-8 w-full">
  <DaysGridEmbed
    lambda={3.0}
    delta={20}
    len={60}
    target={2}
    seed={42}
    showOverlay={true}
    client:load
  />
</div>

Look at the distribution. Most days are dim, meaning we haven't hit our target. In fact, barely any focus blocks over 30 minutes. A few days are brighter, but they're rare. This is what it feels like when you say "some weeks, I just can't get anything done." You're not imagining it. Given these parameters, the math makes it structurally difficult to have consistent high-capacity days.

And remember: λ = 3.0 is _generous_ compared to the research. Bailey et al. report λ ≈ 15 for general knowledge workers. Meyer et al. report λ = 4–6 for developers. Even this "typical" grid is more forgiving than many real-world environments.

### What the Research Data Actually Looks Like

OK, so what does it look like when we use the actual research numbers? Here's 100 days with λ = 15 (the Bailey et al. knowledge worker data—one interruption every four minutes) and Δ = 25 (moderate recovery time):

<div class="not-prose my-8 w-full">
  <DaysGridEmbed
    lambda={15}
    delta={25}
    len={60}
    target={1}
    seed={999}
    showOverlay={true}
    client:load
  />
</div>

If you're looking at this grid and thinking "is the visualization broken?"—I had the same reaction when I first generated it. The entire grid is gray. Uniform hatched patterns, no color variation, no visible focus blocks. It looks like a rendering bug.

But it's not broken. Here's what a single day at these parameters actually looks like:

<div class="not-prose my-8 w-full">
  <DayDetailEmbed
    lambda={15}
    delta={25}
    len={60}
    seed={999}
    day={1}
    showNavigation={false}
    client:load
  />
</div>

Now you can see why the grid appears uniformly gray. There's simply no focus time, even under 15 minutes. The day view is a dense wall of red interruptions, each triggering a gray recovery period. The tiny slivers of green focus time are too short to even render at the grid scale. When you zoom out to 100 days, every single day looks like this. All days are dim.

This is the modern workplace. Bailey et al. measured λ = 15 for general knowledge workers. Microsoft reports λ = 30 for heavy collaborators. These researchers are describing millions of people's actual working conditions. And at these parameters, the math is unambiguous: deep work is statistically near-impossible. We've normalized an environment where focus has been engineered out of the workday, and we're surprised when people can't think.

**An important caveat:** These simulations use a Poisson process, which assumes interruptions arrive randomly and uniformly throughout the day. In reality, interruptions tend to cluster—back-to-back meetings, Slack storms after a big announcement, email bursts when you return from lunch. This clustering cuts both ways. Sometimes it leaves clean gaps (your afternoon block after a morning full of meetings). But often it makes things worse, because clustered interruptions compound recovery time and eliminate any chance of regaining focus between hits. The extreme case shown here is actually somewhat optimistic if your interruptions cluster poorly.

Now let's see what happens if we move to a better regime. Same 8-hour days, same θ = 60, but now λ = 1.0 (one interruption per hour) and Δ = 10 (10-minute recovery).

<div class="not-prose my-8 w-full">
  <DaysGridEmbed
    lambda={1.0}
    delta={10}
    len={60}
    target={3}
    seed={123}
    showOverlay={true}
    client:load
  />
</div>

Look at the difference. Almost all days have more than 3 blocks of 60 minute work, meaning they light up like a Christmas tree. The dim "hopeless" days are much rarer. The distribution has shifted—not because you suddenly became more disciplined, but because the system's parameters changed. The math has spoken.

If you take away one thing from this post, it's this: **the variability you experience across days is structural, not personal.** When λ and Δ are high, bad days are common. When λ and Δ are lower, good days become routine. When they are high, even by tiny amounts, it's hell. The difference between good and bad conditions is **not incremental**, it's **catastrophic**.

Moreover, "thanks to" randomness, you have a lot less control over what your day looks like. For example, here's a breezy day with almost no interruptions (λ = 1) and a short recovery period (Δ = 15). With not one, not two but three 60+ minute blocks, this is a great day!

<div class="not-prose my-8 w-full">
  <DayDetailEmbed
    lambda={1}
    delta={15}
    len={60}
    seed={12345}
    day={43}
    showNavigation={false}
    client:load
  />
</div>

Yet, it's also possible to have a very bad day with a lot of interruptions with the same exact metrics. Note that while you have multiple 45+ minute blocks, you simply can't get a single 60 minute block on this day.

<div class="not-prose my-8 w-full">
  <DayDetailEmbed
    lambda={1}
    delta={15}
    len={60}
    seed={12345}
    day={50}
    showNavigation={false}
    client:load
  />
</div>

## The Map of Deep Work

So far we've fixed the knobs (λ, Δ, θ) and watched the random outcomes (individual days, grids of 100 days). Now let's see what happens when we actually turn those knobs—when we vary λ and Δ systematically and measure the result.

That's what a parameter-space heatmap does. On one axis, we have λ (interruptions per hour). The other axis is Δ (recovery minutes). Each cell represents a specific (λ, Δ) combination, and the color shows the expected capacity (number of θ-minute blocks per day). Dark purple cells are hospitable to deep work. Light purple cells are bad—you're lucky to get even one θ-block per day.

Here's the map, with a threshold control that lets you toggle θ between 30, 45, and 60 minutes. I've highlighted three specific cells with color-coded borders:

<div class="not-prose my-8 w-full">
  <FocusBlocksHeatmapEmbed
    threshold={60}
    showThresholdControl={true}
    highlightedCells={[
      { lambda: 1.0, delta: 10, color: '#22c55e' },
      { lambda: 2.0, delta: 20, color: '#f59e0b' },
      { lambda: 3.0, delta: 25, color: '#ef4444' },
    ]}
    client:load
  />
</div>

Spend a moment looking at the three color-coded cells. These aren't arbitrary—they're anchored, with some generous softening, to the research we saw earlier:

- The **"good" regime** (green border, λ = 1.0, Δ = 10) is better than most real-world environments. It's closer to a protected morning on a maker's schedule, or a team that's serious about focus time.
- The **"typical" regime** (amber border, λ = 2.0, Δ = 20) is still more generous than the ~15 interruptions/hour Bailey et al. report for general knowledge workers, but it's already rough for 60-minute deep work.
- The **"terrible" regime** (red border, λ = 3.0, Δ = 25) is a softened version of the heavy-collaborator world (30 interruptions/hour). The actual PM/team-lead reality often lives off the right edge of this chart.

Now use the threshold control to toggle θ between 30, 45, and 60 minutes. Watch what happens to the three highlighted cells:

- In the **"good" regime** (green border), the cell stays relatively dark even at θ = 60. High capacity: you can expect multiple 60-minute blocks per day.
- In the **"typical" regime** (amber border), the cell looks dark at θ = 30, lightens at θ = 45, and nearly washes out at θ = 60. The capacity collapses as θ increases—this is why you feel like you can handle small tasks but never get to the hard problems.
- In the **"terrible" regime** (red border), the cell is basically washed out at any θ that matters. Near-zero capacity: even 30-minute blocks are rare.

### The Capacity Formula in Action

Remember the capacity formula from earlier? Let's see it work on a concrete example. Suppose you have a day with three focus blocks: 90 minutes, 45 minutes, and 20 minutes. Your total focus time is 155 minutes. But how much _capacity_ do you have—how many units of real work can you complete?

It depends on θ. Watch how the same focus time translates into wildly different capacities:

**For θ = 30 minutes:**

$$
C(30) = \left\lfloor \frac{90}{30} \right\rfloor
      + \left\lfloor \frac{45}{30} \right\rfloor
      + \left\lfloor \frac{20}{30} \right\rfloor
      = 3 + 1 + 0 = 4
$$

Four units of work. Not bad.

**For θ = 45 minutes:**

$$
C(45) = \left\lfloor \frac{90}{45} \right\rfloor
      + \left\lfloor \frac{45}{45} \right\rfloor
      + \left\lfloor \frac{20}{45} \right\rfloor
      = 2 + 1 + 0 = 3
$$

Three units. The 20-minute block is now too small to count, and the 90-minute block only yields two units instead of three.

**For θ = 60 minutes:**

$$
C(60) = \left\lfloor \frac{90}{60} \right\rfloor
      + \left\lfloor \frac{45}{60} \right\rfloor
      + \left\lfloor \frac{20}{60} \right\rfloor
      = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1
$$

One unit. Only the 90-minute block survives. The 45-minute and 20-minute blocks are now useless for this kind of work.

Same 155 minutes of total focus time. But depending on θ, your capacity ranges from 4 down to 1. This is why the heatmap changes so dramatically when you toggle the threshold control—because the floor function is unforgiving. Small changes in θ or in the length of your focus blocks can collapse your capacity.

## How a Better Day Actually Looks

Now let's return to the day-level view and see, visually, what it looks like to move from the "typical" (amber) regime to the "good" (green) one.

Here's another day from the "typical" regime (λ = 2.0, Δ = 20, θ = 60), same parameters as the first timeline we saw:

<div class="not-prose my-8 w-full">
  <DayDetailEmbed
    lambda={2.0}
    delta={20}
    len={60}
    seed={43}
    day={7}
    showNavigation={false}
    client:load
  />
</div>

Look familiar? Lots of red interruptions. Wide gray recovery zones. Very few green blocks longer than 45 minutes. This is what a structurally difficult day looks like. And remember: λ = 2.0 is actually generous compared to the research data—many real environments have λ = 4, 6, or even 15.

Now here's a day from the "good" regime (λ = 1.0, Δ = 10, θ = 60):

<div class="not-prose my-8 w-full">
  <DayDetailEmbed
    lambda={1.0}
    delta={10}
    len={60}
    seed={123}
    day={2}
    showNavigation={false}
    client:load
  />
</div>

The difference is striking. Fewer interruptions. Narrower recovery zones. More and longer green focus blocks. You can see multiple 60-minute chunks—actual capacity for deep work.

This is what happens when you move from the "typical" highlighted cell on the heatmap to the "good" one. The change in parameters is modest: λ drops from 2.0 to 1.0 (one fewer interruption per hour), and Δ drops from 20 to 10 (ten fewer minutes of recovery). But the impact on your day is dramatic.

The point is not that you need to hit these exact numbers. The point is that **you have levers you can pull**, and moving even partway toward the "good" regime makes a visible, measurable difference.

## How to Move Around the Map

Here's the map frozen at θ = 60—the world of serious deep work:

<div class="not-prose my-8 w-full">
  <FocusBlocksHeatmapEmbed
    threshold={60}
    showThresholdControl={false}
    highlightedCells={[
      { lambda: 1.0, delta: 10, color: '#22c55e' },
      { lambda: 2.0, delta: 20, color: '#f59e0b' },
      { lambda: 3.0, delta: 25, color: '#ef4444' },
    ]}
    client:load
  />
</div>

So far this post has been diagnostic: I've shown you what your day looks like under the hood, named the three parameters that determine whether it's productive or a disaster, grounded those parameters in research, and given you a map of the terrain. Now let's talk about what you can actually _do_ with this model.

You have three levers. Let's take them one at a time.

### Reduce λ – Fewer Interruptions Per Hour

Lambda is about **access**. The good news: it's the most impactful lever you have, based on the math. And since it's about access, in theory, it's what you have most control over. Protect your calendar, get fewer interruptions. Easy, right?

<Callout variant="important" title="Non-Linear Impact">
  Doubling interruptions **more than doubles** the lost time due to chain
  interruptions (interruptions during recovery) and fragmentation (reducing
  capacity even when total time is the same).
</Callout>

Unfortunately, reality begs to differ. People in leadership positions want to be available to others, so they keep their calendars open. And people in IC roles often don't get to control their calendars as much as they'd like—those pesky managers keep putting meeting after meeting.

However, there are still things you can do. Making it a habit to check your inboxes a few times a day at most—if not just a couple times—will pay huge dividends. In my experience, almost nothing is actually urgent, and it's better to train people that getting your attention requires effort than to train them that you're always available.

### Reduce Δ – Shorten Recovery Time

Delta is about **stickiness**. It's how long interruptions linger after they're technically over. You can't make Δ zero, but you can shave minutes off each recovery, and those minutes compound quickly.

Meyer et al. report that developers take 10–45 minutes to regain context after an interruption. The variance is huge, and much of it comes from preparedness and task similarity. If you're on the high end (Δ ≈ 40), small hygiene improvements can cut that in half.

**Work hygiene:**

- **Leave yourself breadcrumbs** before switching tasks. When you're interrupted, write a one-sentence note about what you were doing and what comes next. This shortens the reload time when you return.
- **Avoid wide context switches.** If you're interrupted while coding, handling a quick code-review question is less disruptive than handling a budget question. Minimize cross-domain bouncing when possible.

**Environment:**

- **Reduce self-interruptions.** Delta applies to self-inflicted interruptions too (checking Twitter, tab-surfing). Every time you pull yourself out of flow, you pay the recovery cost.
- **Small rituals to re-enter focus.** Some people re-read the last few lines of code they wrote, or scan their notes, or take three deep breaths. These rituals can shorten the reload time.

### Match θ to Reality – Design Tasks for Your Environment

Theta is different from λ and Δ, because you usually can't change the nature of the work itself. If you're working on a hard problem that genuinely requires 90 minutes of continuous thought, that's just θ = 90—end of story.

But you _can_ design your day as a portfolio of tasks with different θ values, and match them to your realistic λ and Δ conditions.

**Break large projects into smaller tasks:**

If your environment has λ = 3 and you're trying to do θ = 90 work, you're going to have a bad time. The heatmap says so. But if you can decompose that work into tasks with θ = 30, suddenly it becomes feasible.

**Reserve low-λ windows for high-θ work:**

If you can defend a 2-hour window early in the morning with λ ≈ 0, that's where you do your θ = 60–90 work. Use the rest of your day (higher λ) for smaller tasks that tolerate fragmentation.

**Accept that some work is incompatible with some environments:**

If you're a PM or team lead living at λ = 30 (per the Microsoft data), θ = 60 work at 3pm is fantasy. You need to either carve out radically different conditions (early morning, off-site, blocked calendar) or accept that this kind of work simply doesn't happen in your normal day.

**What this looks like on the map:**

Remember, when you adjust theta, you're not moving on the map. You're _choosing a different map_. When you toggle the threshold control on the heatmap from θ = 60 to θ = 30, you're asking a different question: "What environment do I need for 30-minute work instead of 60-minute work?" The map changes, and suddenly the "typical" (amber) and "terrible" (red) regimes look more survivable.

## From "Bad Days" to a Tuneable System

This stuff is hard. And of course, like [any other model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong), this model of a work day is wrong. You simply cannot [reverse Taylorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management) your way out of a crazy calendar by inventing theta and putting "focus blocks" on a calendar.

However, [knowing is truly half the battle](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndKnowingIsHalfTheBattle). And I truly believe that like in any endeavor, the most important thing is to believe that we can win the battle. So know this: **You're not uniquely undisciplined. You're operating in a system where, given your λ and Δ, deep work is mathematically rare unless you deliberately design for it.**

The good news is that you have levers. You can harden your notifications, batch your meetings, leave yourself breadcrumbs, defend specific hours, and match your task granularity to your realistic environment. Even small movements on the map—dropping λ from 3 to 2, or Δ from 25 to 15—can transform your distribution of days.

Try this: pick one week and defend a single 90-minute block each morning. Treat that block as your λ/Δ/θ lab. No meetings, no Slack, no "quick questions." Measure what you accomplish in that block versus the rest of your day. I suspect you'll see the parameters at work.

Underneath these pictures there's real math and decades of interruption research. But you don't need any of that to start using the knobs. If you ever find yourself wondering exactly how the curves are shaped, there's a whole rabbit hole waiting for you.
